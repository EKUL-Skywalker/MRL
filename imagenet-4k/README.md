# ImageNet-4K
## Details
ImageNet-4K consists of 4,214 classes and 1,050 images per class. The dataset is split into 1,000 images for the database and 50 images for the query set. The ImageNet-4K classes are a subset of ImageNet-21K classes which do not overlap with ImageNet-1K and contain 1,050 or more images each. The database/query sets contain contain ∼4.2M and ∼200K total images respectively. The list of images curated together to construct ImageNet-4K can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1HFg0FzC5bJgG9h1EShhl1mBgsqpIEydT). The mapping from ImageNet ID to class name and definition can be found in [IDtoClass.txt](IDtoClass.txt).

### Obtaining the Dataset
To construct ImageNet-4K first obtain [ImageNet-21K](https://www.image-net.org/) (the full ImageNet from [Deng et al 2009](https://www.image-net.org/static_files/papers/imagenet_cvpr09.pdf)). Once obtained create a subset of the data using the list of images [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1HFg0FzC5bJgG9h1EShhl1mBgsqpIEydT). Please email [Aditya Kusupati](http://www.adityakusupati.com/) for further questions and assistance regarding the dataset.
