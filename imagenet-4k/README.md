# ImageNet-4K
We created the ImageNet-4K dataset by selecting 4,202 classes, non-overlapping with ImageNet1K, from ImageNet-21K with 1,050 or more examples. The train set contains 1,000 examples and
the query/validation set contains 50 examples per class totalling to ∼4.2M and ∼200K respectively.
The list of images curated together to construct ImageNet-4K can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1HFg0FzC5bJgG9h1EShhl1mBgsqpIEydT). The mapping from ImageNet ID to class name and definition can be found in [4k_mapping.txt](4k_mapping.txt).
